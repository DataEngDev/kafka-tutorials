Next, create an Avro schema file at `src/main/avro/countsum.avsc` for the pair of counts and sums:

+++++
<pre class="snippet"><code class="avro">{% include_raw tutorials/aggregating-average/kstreams/code/src/main/avro/countsum.avsc %}</code></pre>
+++++

NOTE: We're going to use this pair to store intermediate results. 
The reason why we're using avro schema for this is that we can use `SpecificAvroSerde` to handle all our serialization needs.
